DarwinBSD
Goals
The goal of the DarwinBSD project is to provide resources for open source developers to interact and produce products for Darwin. One of the key aspects of the project is to enable interested Darwin developers to be able to retrieve, modify, build, and distribute operating system changes.

DarwinBSD will work with pkgsrc as a system packages and it will have Windowmaker as a window manager.

Organization
The project has a Core Team, similar to the other various BSD projects. We are currently seeking contributors for all aspects of the project, and additions to the Core Team will be chosen from the most active contributors. One of the initial Core Team's first action items is to establish the rules for how future Core Team and project members will be selected.

Contributing
The DarwinBSD project is always looking for talented individuals to contribute to and join the project. To contribute to the DarwinBSD project, you can join some of the DarwinBSD mailing lists and participate in discussion. You can also join the IRC discussion on the #darwinbsd channel on irc.libera.chat Contributing to the project can be anything from helping others on the mailing lists to sending in patches. The website could use some enhancement and supervision as well.
